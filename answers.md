- **1b)** The work of this alogirthm when V is the vertices and E is the edges is O(ElogE) and the span is also O(ElogE)



- **2b)** I do not know what answer you want it. It was unclear but the code is in main.py. This code checks if destination is in parents and if it is not it is a recursive call. It repeatedly looks up the parent of the current node until it reaches the source node, adding the nodes along the path as it goes.
